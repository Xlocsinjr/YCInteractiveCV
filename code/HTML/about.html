            <p>My name is Xander Locsin!</p>
            <p>I am <span id="ageStatement"></span> years old and I live in Amsterdam.</p>
            <p>
              I have an interest in science 
              and programming and I have been educated in Physics. Besides academics, I also  
              have an artistic side with hobbies like 3d modeling, dancing and drawing.

              In general, I am a bit of a reserved person but I have never 
              had issues working in cooperation with others. I like understanding things, 
              rather than just knowing. Since I like thinking about why things are, I consider 
              myself an understanding person and I always try to be unbiased and considerate,  
              and I value honesty and fairness.

            Programming feels like puzzling to me. To solve a puzzle you consider what you know 
            and how you can use that knowledge to logically arrive at a solution. In programming 
            I would apply my knowledge on tools and languages to get to a working solution. Additionally 
            I find it rewarding to see that the impact of your work is clearly visible because your efforts 
            result in a functioning program or solution! This is why I enjoy programming!

            <h3>3d Modeling / Animation</h3>
            <p>
              I had been part of a game development group with friends who had asked me 
              to learn 3d modeling in Blender. Now I still do it as a hobby.
              I have also tried a bit of animating but I am far from creating true animation
              videos.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like seeing my own ideas turned into 3d visualised objects. It is a time 
              consuming hobby but it does deliver impressive results!

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>
              I have liked to draw ever since I was young. I have never felt the need to try to 
              become a professional artist but it has always been a consistent hobby of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have an interest in vintage fashion so I mostly draw vintage inspired outfits, 
              but I also draw other outfits and fantasy characters. In general I stick to drawing 
              people rather than objects or landscapes.

            <h3>Dance</h3>
            <p>
              Since 2019 I have been part of a dance group with friends. We cover 
              the choreographies of perfomances of Korean pop songs by k-pop groups.

              at a k-pop related meetup.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
              I also play guitar and sing. I like folk and country music, which is very 
              suitable for me to play and sing by myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I do occasionally record myself 
              but I do consider that kind of music to be better when played live. Despite that, 
              I do not really like performing for an audience.

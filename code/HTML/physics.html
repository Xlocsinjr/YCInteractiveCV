              With an interest in the sciences and in the way the world works I 
              chose to study Physics. Physics is the study of how the universe 
              behaves on scales from galaxy clusters to the inside of atoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ofcourse, in Physics I would learn about our world with courses like 
              classical mechanics, special relativity, quantum mechanics, optics, astronomy, 
              thermal physics, and electrodynamics, but I also had courses like math, 
              practicals and research projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The behaviour of the universe can be described with math and so 
              math is everywhere in the field of physics. In addition to knowledge 
              of physics I have also developed mathematical skills in which 
              critical thinking is important. To solve a problem in math, you 
              consider what you know and how to apply that knowledge to get to
              a solution. In that regard, programming is not very different.

          During my study of Physics I first came into contact with programming. 
          I have learned to use programming to 
          apply math, to display data in meaningful ways, and to simulate physical 
          phenomena.

            <h3>Introduction in Python</h3>
            <p>
              The first time I had learned anything about programming was during the 
              programming courses of my study of physics. I was taught the basics of 
              <b>Python</b> like printing statements, mathematical operations, loops, 
              and defining functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would say the main purpose of learning programming in physics is to apply 
              <b>math</b>, like mathematical operations, equation solving, 
              or implementing mathematical functions, to analyse (experimental) data to find 
              meaningful relations or patterns within that data and that was what I was 
              taught in the programming courses.

            <h3>Plotting</h3>
            <p>
              I learned to use programming in Python to create <b>graphs and charts</b> to 
              display data in way that easily conveys meaningful information from the relations 
              or patterns within the data.

              The image to the right shows a graph that displays the transmission of waves 
              between two elastically coupled pendula at different frequencies of oscillation 
              for my bachelor thesis.

            <h3>Simulations</h3>
            <p>
              Since our universe follows rules that can be described by math 
              it is also possible to <b>simulate</b> those rules via programming. For example, 
              I have learned to simulate the trajectory of charged particles among static charges 
              or the Electric potential field of different charge distributions.
            </p>

              To the right is a simulation to show the trajectory of a charged particle inside a 
              box of static point charges with additional randomly placed static point charges within.

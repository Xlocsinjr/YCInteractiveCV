            I am a graduate of BSc Physics and Astronomy with an interest in Programming. 
            Having been educated in a science, I learned to value critical thinking, objectivity and correctness. 
            Additionally, having completed a Minor in Programming, 
            I have gained an appreciation for the problem solving way of work of Programming and the challenges that it brings. 
            Both my study of Physics and Programming have given me experience in applying relevant knowledge and techniques to 
            solve a problem.

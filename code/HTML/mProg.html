          <p>Having developed an interest in programming during my study of physics I decided to also
            do a minor in programming, where I was taught basic concepts of programming. During the minor 
            I was given the choice between the Data processing and App studio courses and I had chosen to
            follow the Data processing course as it was more relevant to me as a student of Physics since
            working with data is also applicable in Physics.

            <h3>Introduction in C and Python</h3>
            <p>The first part of the minor consisted of full-time programming courses that followed
               Harvard's <b>cs50 program</b>, where I was taught basic concepts of programming including
               data types, conditional statements and loops.

            <h3>Data processing</h3>
            <p>
              In the Data processing course I was taught how to rework data (with <b>Python</b>) so it can be displayed in 
              interactive ways. Creating the <b>data-visualisations</b>, like barcharts
               and line-graphs, and its interactive elements were done with <b>javascript</b> and the javascript D3.js library.
            </p>

               or on the image to open the interactive data visualisation in a new tab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hovering over the calender squares and the barchart bars displays that element's
               specific data. Click on a date on the calendar to show that date's temperatures 
              in the barchart.

            <h3>Programming project</h3>
            <p>
              The final project for the minor Programming was a continuation of the Data processing course. 
              The objective was to create three <b>interactively linked charts/graphs</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              An image of the results can be seen to the right. You can click
               <a href="https://xlocsinjr.github.io/progProject/code/HTML/progProject.html" target="_blank">here</a>

            </p>
            <p>
              The page aims to visualise the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how
               these emissions relate to a country's GDP. This is done by a world map, a grouped bar chart,
               and a scatterplot. The visualisations are interactive and the functionality of the page is
               explained on the right side of the page.

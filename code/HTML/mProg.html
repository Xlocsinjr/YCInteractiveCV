          <p>Having developed an interest in programming during my study of physics I decided to also
            do a minor in programming, where I was taught basic concepts of programming. During the minor 
            I was given the choice between the Data processing and App studio courses and I had chosen to
            follow the Data processing course as it was more relevant to me as a student of Physics since
            working with data is also applicable in Physics.

            <h3>Introduction in C and Python</h3>
            <p>The first part of the minor consisted of full-time programming courses that followed
               Harvard's cs50 program, where I was taught basic concepts of programming including
               data types, conditional statements and loops.

            <h3>Data processing</h3>
            <p>
              In the Data processing course I was taught how to take data and rework that data (with Python) so it can be displayed in various
               interactive ways. Creating the data-visualisations, like barcharts
               and line-graphs, and its interactive elements were done with javascript and the javascript D3.js library.

              An example of what I learned to make can be seen in the image to the right. You can click

               or on the image to open the interactive data visualisation in a new tab.

              A python script reordered temperature data from weather stations into a json file which a javascript script displayed in
               a barchart and a calender view. Hovering over the calender squares and the barchart bars displays that element's
               specific data. You can also click on a date on the calendar to show the minimum, average and maximum
               temperature measured at the various weather stations at that date in the bar chart.

            <h3>Programming project</h3>
            <p>
              The final project for the minor Programming was a continuation of the Data processing course. 
              The objective was to create three interactively linked charts/graphs.

            <p>
              An image of the results can be seen to the right. You can click

            <p>
              The page aims to visualise the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how
               these emissions relate to a country's GDP. This is done by a world map, a grouped bar chart,
               and a scatterplot. The visualisations are interactive and the functionality of the page is
               explained on the right side of the page.
